# Powerpredict-ML

Powerpredict is a project aimed at predicting power consumption based on weather information. The prediction of power consumption is highly relevant for energy suppliers as it helps them efficiently plan and manage their resources. This repository contains the necessary code and dataset to build a power consumption prediction model using weather data.

## Dataset

The dataset provided in this repository consists of weather information and corresponding power consumption data. The weather information includes variables such as rain, sunshine, temperature, and more. The power consumption data represents the daily power usage.

The dataset is structured as a CSV file, where each row represents a single day's weather and power consumption data. The columns contain the various weather variables and the power consumption values.
